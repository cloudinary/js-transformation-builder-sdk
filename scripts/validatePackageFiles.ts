 *              2. All files in the file system exist in the Tree that was required (no unwanted files)
 *
 *              The function throws for both errors (MissingRequiredFile, FoundNonRequiredFile)
 *
 *              If a tree value (tree[fileName]) is equal to false, all validations are skipped for that file
 *              (That means we don't try to match for it, and we don't care if it exists in the file system)
 *              We also don't check any of its children.
 *
 *              It's possible to turn off FoundNonRequiredFile for a specific folder level by providing a
 *              $suppressNonRequiredFilesError flag in that level of the tree.
 *
 *              Eg. tree = {a: {$suppressNonRequiredFilesError:true, nestedUnderA: 'a file}}
 *
 *              In the above example, we won't check if a has children in the file system that don't exist in the tree
 *              But we do check that a.nestedUnderA exists in the file system
